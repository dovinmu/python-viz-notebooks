This repo is for directly comparing various Python libraries for data visualization, as well as a discussion of their strengths and weaknesses.

For the libraries that output Javascript (Folium, Bokeh, Altair, sometimes Plotly), go to the Notebook Viewer page for [this repository](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dovinmu/python-viz-notebooks/tree/master/) to read them.

Dependencies:
 * Anaconda (Python 3)
 * Basemap

Tools I'm exploring:
 * Matplotlib
 * pandas
 * Bokeh
 * Plot.ly
 * Seaborn
 * holoviews
 * datashader
 * Altair
 * Basemap
