This repo is for directly comparing various Python libraries for data visualization, as well as a discussion of their strengths and weaknesses. Most of what I'm planning on adding to this repo will be in Jupyter Notebooks.

Dependencies:
 * Anaconda (Python 3)
 * Basemap

Tools I'll explore:
 * Matplotlib
 * pandas
 * Bokeh
 * Plot.ly
 * Seaborn
 * holoviews
 * datashader
 * Altair
 * Basemap
